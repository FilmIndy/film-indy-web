### Local Dev - Getting Started

1. `npm install`
2. `npm start` -> should open a browser to locahost:3000

### Linting
1. `npm install -g eslint`
2. Install eslint addon for whatever editor you have
3. For vscode use [this](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint) and hit `CTRL-COMMA` and add the following settings
```json
    "eslint.enable": true,
    "eslint.autoFixOnSave": true
}
```
This should show lint erros in VS Code and will autoformat the code when you save. 

### Deploying to Firebase

1. `npm i -g firebase-tools` (Optional if you already have this installed)
3. `firebase login`(shouldn't need to do this if you have done this command recently)
4. `npm run build` -> build production assets in build directory
5. `firebase deploy`-> deploy app to [https://film-indy.firebaseapp.com/](https://film-indy.firebaseapp.com/)
